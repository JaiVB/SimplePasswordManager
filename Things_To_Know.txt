Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 or PBKDF2:
- it is a cryptographic algorithm that takes a password and turns it into a secure key for encryption or authentication
- It slows down brute-force attacks by repeatedly hashing the password with a salt.


Core Idea
Takes in 4 Main Inputs:
    Password: User's plain password
    Salt: Random String added to make each derived key unique
    Iterations: Number of time the function is applied to make the cracking(harder to decrpyt) harder
    Desired Key Length: How long the key should be in bytes


Process:
    Step 1:
        Combine password and salt
    Step 2:
        Hash them with a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256
    Step 3:
        Repeat the hashing thousands of times (for example, 100,000+ iterations)
    Step 4:
        Output the derived key, which can be used for AES encryption or stored for password verification


AESGCM  (AES in Galois/Counter Mode)
- Provides:
    Confidentiality (data is encrypted)
    integrity (data can't be modified unnoticed)
- Part of the cryptography libary
    from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.aead import AESGCM


Nonce (Number used once)
- Random value that must be unique every time you encrpyt somethign with the same key
- Usually 12 bytes long
- Ensures you get different ciphertexts
